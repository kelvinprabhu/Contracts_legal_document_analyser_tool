Hackathon Use Case Document: Contract Evaluation Tool
Problem Statement
Manually reviewing and analyzing contracts is labor-intensive, error-prone, and often inconsistent. There is a need for an automated system that can analyze contract documents, assess risks, generate structured insights, and provide an accessible interface for evaluators. Build a contract analyzer tool for Hari and Winston Associates LLC to automate the process of contract review.

Deliverables
•	Contract Analyzer Tool: A system that ingests contract documents, evaluates clauses, assigns scores, and produces clear summaries and insights.
•	Integrated Chatbot: A chatbot which exposes the knowledge processed by the contract evaluation tool through a conversational layer.
Pre-conditions
•	Contract documents will be provided by us.
•	A language model will be made available.
Use Case Description
1.	The user uploads the contract into the system.
2.	The system parses the contract, extracting clauses and relevant legal/operational terms.
3.	Clause level risk flags (High/Medium/Low) are generated based on potential exposure or non-compliance.
4.	Highlights ambiguous or one-sided clauses that may expose the company to undue risk.
5.	Suggest alternative wording or best-practice clauses to mitigate risk.
6.	An overall contract score is computed.
7.	Clause summaries are created. Highlighting compliance status, risks and gaps.
8.	All extracted data, scores, and insights are indexed for quick access.
9.	An integrated chatbot allows evaluators to query specific clauses, compare sections, or request overall summaries.

Example Evaluation Criteria for Contracts
•	Completeness: Coverage of key legal and operational clauses.
•	Compliance: Alignment with organizational or regulatory standards.
•	Risk Exposure: Identification of clauses introducing potential liabilities.
•	Clarity & Consistency: Detection of ambiguous or conflicting terms.
•	Cost/Benefit Balance: Evaluation of financial terms for fairness and efficiency.
Constraints
•	Frontend simplicity: Streamlit suffices.
•	All other development requirements other than the language model must be sourced by participants.
Post-Conditions
•	Clause-level summaries, alternative wordings are available. 
•	Chatbot can respond to queries about contract evaluation.
